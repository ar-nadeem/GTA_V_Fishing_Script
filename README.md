# GTA_V_Scripts
For Eclipse server

# What is this ?
This is an auto fishing script for GTA V online. It scanns pixels on screen for specific queues. Then press keys accordingly to catch fishes in game. Fishing was an easy money making scheme in the server I was playing at. And I watned to get rich overnight.

# Did it work ?
Yes, but people would attack me and steal my fishes, as I was away when the script was working.
